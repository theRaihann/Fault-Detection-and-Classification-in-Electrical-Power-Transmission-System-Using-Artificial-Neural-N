## Fault Detection and Classification in Electrical Power Transmission System Using Artificial Neural Network and Machine Learning

The goal of the project is to detect electrical fault location on electrical power transmission 
line and to classify the fault using artificial neural network. The instantaneous values of the 
three phase currents and voltages measured from one side of the transmission line has been 
used to produce datasets for training our models. Several machine learning 
algorithms have been used to make a comparison between the performances of the different models. The 
comparison shows that artificial neural network performs satisfactorily with good percentiles.
For generating data, a small power system has been simulated with one transmission line in 
Simulink, MATLAB. Various types of faults have been introduced at different locations on the 
transmission line for some electrical cycles and instantaneous data has been used to produce datasets.
